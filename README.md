ID hashing and Obfuscation using Knuth's Algorithm for C++

This is just a simple port of https://github.com/pjebs/optimus-go library for C++.

Check example folder for learn how to use this library.

You could use it if you need your ids to consist of only numbers. It's based on Knuth's integer hash method and produces obfuscated integer ids. There are PHP (https://github.com/jenssegers/optimus) and Go (https://github.com/pjebs/optimus-go) implementations.
